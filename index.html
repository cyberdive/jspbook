<h1>Java Server Pages: Dynamic Web Sites Made Easy</h1>

<p>
Included on this CD-ROM are all the code examples from the book.  From
this page you can select any chapter and view the JSP text and bean
code from that chapter.  Even more exciting, however, all the code can
actually be run!
</p>


<p>
In order to do this, you must first set up and run Tomcat, the JSP
engine from the Jakarta project.  The latest version of Tomcat at the
time this book was written is included on this CD.  Instructions for
setting everyting up are included <a href="tomcat.html">here</a>.  You
should also periodically check the <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org">Jakarta home page</a> for new
versions and related projects.
</p>


<p>
Many of the examples in this book rely on a database.  We used
PostgreSQL, a high-quality free database.  PostgreSQL is available
from <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">here</a>, and instructions
for setting it up are included on <a href="postgresql.html">this
CD</a>.  Alternately, you might prefer to use <a
href="http://www.mysql.org">MySQL</a> or <a
href="http://www.hughes.com.au/">Msql</a>.  If so, some the SQL in the
examples will need to be modified.
</p>

<p>
Examples that require PostgreSQL will be indicated with the word
(postgresql) in parenthesis.
</p>

<p>
Also included on this CD are two utilities from Canetoad Software.  <a
href="table2bean.html">Table2Bean</a> creates beans from databse
tables.  <a href="beaneditor.html">BeanEditor</a> allows users to edit
and save serializable beans.
</p>

<p>
Code is available for the following chapters. Due to a bug in the
current version of Tomcat, it may be necessary to shut down and
restart it between visits to each chapter.
