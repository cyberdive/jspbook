<H1>The PostgreSQL database</H1>

<P>Many of the examples in this book require a database with a JDBC
driver.  There are many such databases available, but we have decided
to use PostgreSQL, a high-quality open source database, available for
Linux, Solaris and other Unixes.  RPMs for Redhat 5.2 and 6.x are
include on this CD in the postgresql/linux directory.  Full source is
also included, in the postgresql/source directory.  New versions and
documentation may be freely downloaded from <A
HREF="http://www.postgresql.org">http://www.postgresql.org</A>.
Before using PostgreSQL, please read the <a href="PREADME.txt">license</a>.
</P>

<P>A version of PostgreSQL for Windows NT has recently been released
and is included in the postgresql/win32 directory.  Please note that
the examples in this book have not been tested against the NT version.
</P>

<P>
The JDBC component of PostgreSQL is written completely in Java, and
hence can run anywhere, as long as there is a machine on the local
network where the server can be run.
</P>

<p>
If, for whatever reason, you choose not to use PostgreSQL, you are
encouraged to use any other database with a JDBS driver, but note that
many of the examples will need minor changes.  In particular, change
any lines containing <CODE>Class.forName("postgresql.Driver");</CODE>
to a version appropriate for your database.</P>

<P>Assuming you do choose to use PostgreSQL, a few things must be set
up in advance.  Compile and install the database according to the
instructions. Then run the <CODE>initDB</CODE> command as the database
administrator.  Next, replace the contents of the data/pg_hba.conf
file with the following lines:</P>

<PRE>
local        all                                         trust
host         all         127.0.0.1     255.255.255.255   password
</PRE>

<P>Next, start up the server, which is done with this command:</P>

<PRE>
bin/postmaster -i &gt;&amp; log &amp;
</PRE>

<P>Now create a user called dbuser with the command:</P>

<PRE>
createuser dbuser
</PRE>

<P>Give this user a random id, and disallow creating databases and
users.  Next, give this user a password with this command:</P>

<PRE>
psql -c "alter user dbuser with password dbuser;" template1
</PRE>

<P>Next, create a database which we will use throughout
our examples:</P>

<PRE>
createdb jspbook
</PRE>

<P>Finally, load some data into the database with the following
command:</P>

<PRE>
psql -u -f jspbook.sql jspbook
</PRE>

<P>
This will prompt you for a username and password, reply "dbuser" to
both.  This will then create all the tables needed to run all the
examples from the book, and populate them with data,
</P>

<P>Finally, in order to allow Tomcat to use PostgreSQL, copy
postgresql.jar, which should have been included in your PostreSQL
distribution, to a directory in your CLASSPATH.
