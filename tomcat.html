<h1>Setting up Tomcat</h1>

<p>
First, you will need a Java Development Kit or Java Runtime
Environment.  For Solaris and NT, these can be downloaded from <a
href="http://java.sun.com/jdk/">Sun</a>.  JDKs for most versions of
Linux are available from <a
href="http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux.html">Blackdown</a>
</p>

<p>
Before installing Tomcat, please read the <a href="LICENSE.txt">license</a>.
</p>

<p>
The easiest way to get up and running is to copy the directory tomcat,
and all its subdirectories, from the CD to a directory on your hard
drive.
</p>

<p>
Some of the files in this directory have been modified to support the
examples from this book.  If you would like the 'raw' version of
Tomcat, pick a directory in which to install, and unzip tomcat.zip.
This will create a tomcat subdirectory containing all the Tomcat code
and scripts.  Under Unix, make all the scripts runnable with the
following command:
</p>

<pre>
chmod a+x *.sh
</pre>

<p>
To install the examples from this book manually, you can next cd into
the Tomcat directory and unzip jspbook.zip.
</p>

<p>
You are now ready to go!  Under Windows run startup.bat, under
Solaris, Linux, or other Unix run startup.sh.  If you can access <a
href="http://localhost:8080/">this link</a> everything is working
properly.  If not, please see the README and FAQ files in the tomcat
directory.
</p>

<h2>Running Tomcat with Apache</h2>

<p>
All the files needed to run Tomcat with Apache under Linux, Solaris
and Windows are included on this CD.  This is not necessary in order
to run the examples from the book, but combining Apache and Tomcat
makes for a very powerful platform on which to run JSPs for a real
site.  Start with the instructions <a href="howto.txt">here</a>, all
binaries are under the apache directory.  As always, check the <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org">Jakarta home page</a> for updates.
